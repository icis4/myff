# Code of Conduct

This project aims to maintain a safe, respectful, and productive environment for everyone involved — users, contributors, and maintainers.

## Our Pledge
We are committed to fostering a community where we:
- Communicate with respect and a professional tone.
- Embrace differences and encourage constructive dialogue.
- Focus on improving the project and everyone’s experience.

## Expected Behavior
Examples of behavior we encourage:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Giving and receiving feedback constructively.
- Respecting other people’s time, effort, and viewpoints.
- Acknowledging mistakes and being willing to correct them.
- Following repository rules (issue/PR templates, style, tests) when available.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of behavior that is not acceptable:
- Insults, humiliation, harassment, threats, or aggressive tone.
- Discrimination or mockery based on personal characteristics.
- Sexualized comments or unwanted attention.
- Posting personal data (doxxing) or encouraging others to do so.
- Deliberately derailing discussions (spam, trolling, repeated provocations).

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including (but not limited to):
- GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments
- commit messages and code reviews
- project-related communication (chat/email) when officially used

## Reporting an Issue
If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior:
- Send a short description of what happened, a link/screenshot (if possible), and relevant context.
- Report it to the project maintainers at: **[FILL IN CONTACT: email or GitHub handle]**

Please avoid posting sensitive details publicly when doing so could harm affected people.

## Enforcement and Consequences
Project maintainers may take action depending on the situation, for example:
- Clarification/warning and guidance toward appropriate behavior.
- Locking a thread, deleting/editing content.
- Temporary or permanent restriction from participation (ban).

Decisions are made in good faith to protect the community and the project.

## Appeals
If you believe an enforcement action was unfair, contact the maintainers through the same channel and provide context. A re-review will be performed.
